          Hello! I'm Jake Sales, a game developer passionate about creating fun, interesting gameplay systems.
          I recently graduated from UCSC with a CS: Game Design major and am a hard worker with big motivation
          to learn. I specialize in Unity (C#) - Willing to learn other game engines - and love prototyping unique ideas and collaborating with others 
          to build engaging experiences. I'm eager to contribute to exciting projects and grow as a developer!
